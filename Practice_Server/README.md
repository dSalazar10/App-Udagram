# Practice Server

PracticeServer is a simple Node.JS server meant to teach concepts such as installing packages and dependencies.
* Express framework helps us build our webserver. 
* body-parser helps us parse, remove, and make use of inbound requests.
* Mocha is the unit testing framework

## Getting Started

See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

* Download a copy of App-Udagram
* Open a terminal
* Navigate to the Practice_Server directory
* Type in the following code and press enter
```
npm run dev
```

### Prerequisites

The server is dependent on Nodejs and Node Package Manager. Installation instructions can be found
[here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

* To test if Nodejs is installed, execute the following code in your terminal: `npm -v`

We can issue and save requests to the server with ease using Postman. Installation instruction can
be found [here](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/).

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

* Navigate your terminal to the Practice Server directory
* To install the dependencies, run the following command: `npm install`


End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
