# Practice Server

PracticeServer is a simple Node.JS server meant to teach concepts such as installing packages and dependencies.
* Express framework helps us build our webserver. 
* body-parser helps us parse, remove, and make use of inbound requests.
* Mocha and Chai frameworks help us with unit testing.

## Getting Started

You will want to start by download a copy of Udagram and installing the necessary programs. See the Prerequisites docs for
more information on the dependencies.

### Prerequisites

The server is dependent on Nodejs and Node Package Manager. 
* Installation instructions can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* To test if Nodejs is installed, execute the following code in your terminal: `npm -v`

We can issue and save requests to the server with ease using Postman. 
* Installation instruction can be found [here](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/).

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Once you have Node and Postman installed, you are ready to start up a local server.
* Open a terminal
* Navigate to the Practice_Server directory
* Install the dependencies: type the following and press enter `npm install`
* Spin up the server: type the following and press enter `npm run dev`

Now your server is up and running. See the Running the tests docs for more information on testing the server.

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

Now you should be ready to interact with your local server using Postman.
* You will find a Postman script [here](https://github.com/dSalazar10/App-Udagram/blob/master/Practice_Server/udacity-c2-basic-server.postman_collection.json).
