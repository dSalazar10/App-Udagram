@TODO: Complete Readme

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

The server is dependent on Nodejs and Node Package Manager. Installation instructions can be found
[here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

* To test if Nodejs is installed, execute the following code in your terminal: `npm -v`

The server is dependent on the Ionic Command Line Interface. Installation instructions can be found 
[here](https://ionicframework.com/docs/installation/cli).

* To test if Ionic is installed, execute the following code in your terminal: `ionic --version`

We can issue and save requests to the server with ease using Postman. Installation instruction can
be found [here](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/).
