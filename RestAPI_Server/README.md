# RestAPI Server
The RestAPI Server (bottom server) is a nodejs/typescript cloud server which
* Manages user authentication, storing emails and password hashes in an AWS Relational Database Service (DB)
* Manages user data, storing images in an AWS Simple Storage Service (FS)
* Manages image filters using the Image_Filter_Server (top server)

### Prerequisites


* Nodejs and NPM
* Postman
* Postbird
* Visual Studio Code
* Amazon Web Services Account
* AWS CLI

## Getting Started

The server is dependent on Nodejs and Node Package Manager. 
* Installation instructions can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* To test if Nodejs is installed, execute the following code in your terminal: `npm -v`

We can issue and save requests to the server with ease using Postman. 
* Installation instruction can be found [here](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/).

We can interact with our database with ease using Postbird.
* Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/paxa/postbird).

We can interact with our repo with ease using Visual Studio Code.
* Installation instructions can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview).

We will be using multiple services provided by Amazon Web Services, so you will need to set up an account.
* Instructions can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).

We will be interacting with our AWS services using the command line, so you will need the AWS CLI
* Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html).
* To test if aws-cli is installed, execute the following code in your terminal: `aws --version`

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and 
testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system

* Clone the repo
* Open the RestAPI_Server folder in Visual Studio Code
* Open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code
* To install the projectâ€™s dependencies, type in `npm i` and press enter
* To start the server, type in `npm run dev`
* The server can be located at `http://localhost:8080`


### Installing

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

You can deploy this server to the cloud using Amazon Web Services. Instructions to sign up can be 
found [here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/).

Interfacing with AWS can be done through the terminal, which will require AWS CLI. Installation instructions can
be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html).

* To test if AWS CLI is installed, execute the following code in your terminal: `aws --version`
